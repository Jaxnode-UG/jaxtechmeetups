We will show you a variety of competing patterns to load your dimensions and facts more efficiently and discuss the pros and cons of each. You’ll learn how to use SQL Server Change Data Capture integration into SSIS (CDC) and incremental loads to effectively load your data warehouse in the fastest way possible.<\/p> <p>\n\nOne of the most common design patterns needed is how to deal with duplicate data. The speakers will show an end-to-end solution to scrub duplicate data and give rows a scoring system to sift out the best records. You'll also see a number of advanced patterns for lesser-used tasks in SSIS like Term Extraction and Data Mining Transform.<\/p> <p>\n\nThese are just a few of the patterns that we will be demonstrating. With all of the solutions shown, you will be given an end-to-end project with all the packages and data. You'll come out of the session with a lot of options on how to do your ETL job.<\/p> <p>\n\nRemember to bring your laptop since you’ll be able to work with the speakers on many of the patterns.<\/p> <p>\n\nAlso, please note that you will want to have at least beginner SSIS experience for this session.<\/p>","event_url":"http:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Jacksonville-SQL-Server-User-Group\/events\/220027944\/","yes_rsvp_count":3,"duration":28800000,"name":"Full Day SSIS: Problem, Design, Solution Pre-con","id":"220027944","time":1431088200000,"updated":1422020155000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1371154991000,"name":"Jacksonville SQL Server User Group","group_lon":-81.48999786376953,"id":8916872,"urlname":"Jacksonville-SQL-Server-User-Group","group_lat":30.190000534057617,"who":"Members"},"status":"upcoming"},{"utc_offset":-14400000,"venue":{"country":"us","city":"Jacksonville","address_1":"1 UNF Drive Building 50","name":"University of North Florida","lon":-81.510429,"id":18040062,"state":"FL","lat":30.270638,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":50,"headcount":0,"distance":2.725344657897949,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1421866266000,"fee":{"amount":129,"accepts":"paypal","description":"per person","currency":"USD","label":"Regular Price","required":"1"},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><b>Speakers:<\/b><\/p> <p><b>Bradley Ball,<\/b> a Microsoft SQL Server MVP with almost 15 years of IT experience.  Bradley spent 8 years working as a Defense contractor for clients such as the U.S. Army, The Executive Office of the President of the United States, and Publix Supermarkets.  Currently the Data Platform Management Lead for Pragmatic Works and Microsoft VTSP.  He has presented at many SQL Saturdays, for PASS SSUG’s, SQL Rally, DevConnections, SQL Live 360, &amp; the PASS Summit 2011 - 2014.

How do the queries and the tables work together?  Have you ever wondered?  Why should you?  Understanding how SQL Server works internally allows you to know how and when to use SQL Server to solve business problems.  We need to understand the relational engine, index, transaction log, data, and locking internals.  We need to know how these apply to business decisions that we make every day!  Most importantly we need DEMOS!!!  Join SQL Server MVP Bradley Ball &amp; Gareth Swanepoel as we dive into the SQL Server Internals spanning from the Query Processor, through the Storage Engine, the Plan Cache and in between.<\/p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<i><b>Outline:<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b>1.  Inside the Query Optimizer<\/b><\/p> <p>When it comes to making your queries run you need to understand how SQL Server reads a query and how the Optimizer works and return our physical data.  How constraints, statistics, and simplification allow us to write better queries and use advanced techniques for solving every day issues.<\/p> <p>·  Lab: Fixing the terrible, rotten, no good RBAR query<\/p> <p><b>2. Deep Dive Data Internals<\/b><\/p> <p>As a DBA we learn backwards.  Most of the time you get a DBA job and you have Databases, that have tables, and in those tables you have data. Nobody tells you that we have records, stored on Pages, grouped in Extents, assigned by Allocation Bitmaps, with IAM Pages and Allocation Units that span Partitions and Filegroups.  Today is your lucky day, we will start at the bottom and build our way up.  We'll cover byte swapping, bitmaps, and dive a little into decoding Hex &amp; binary.  Working to give you a full understanding of database internals, and how you use them every day!   <i>·  Lab: To Corrupt and Fix a Database<\/i><\/p> <p><b>3. Index Internals<\/b><\/p> <p>Why does SQL Server use an index for some queries and not for others?  What makes a good index?  How many indexes should I have?  Have you ever asked these questions? When you want to understand an application you look at its core architecture. Underneath the covers SQL Server is just a C++ application.  Together we will discuss how the application architecture of SQL Server works, and how to apply this logic to building the best indexes for your queries.  <i>· Lab: Building A Better Index<\/i><\/p> <p><i><b>Break for Lunch<\/b><\/i><\/p> <p><b>4.

In this section, we'll look at the internals for transaction logs and some of the important considerations that need to be taken into account while working with SQL Server.
