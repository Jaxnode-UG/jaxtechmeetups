She received her Ph.D. from North Carolina State University. She has authored scholarly papers in the areas of performance modeling, computer networks, and embedded computer architectures. Her research interests include computing for sustainability, computer networks, performance modeling, and cyber security. She will be presenting her work on an interdisciplinary project with biologist Dr. Mike Stine on data processing for better understanding of the Florida aquifer. For the past ten years the North Florida Springs Alliance has been performing fauna counts in the underwater caves of Northeast Florida.
